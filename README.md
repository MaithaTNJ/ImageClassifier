# ImageClassifier

this project contains two main parts: 

Part 1 - Developing an Image Classifier with Deep Learning

Part 2 - Building the command line application

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Part 1 - Image Classifier Development: 

  file: Image Classifier Project (4).html
  
  In this first part of the project, i worked through a Jupyter notebook through anaconda prompt to implement an image classifier with Python. there are many python Packages that needed in this part, like Numpy, Pandas , json , Pytorch , PIL and MatplotLib.
  The network predicts the species of the flowers.
  
  The part is broken down into multiple steps:

    - Load and preprocess the image dataset
    - Train the image classifier on your dataset
    - Use the trained classifier to predict image content


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
Part 2 - Building the command line application

  files: train.py, predict.py
  
  After building and training a deep neural network on the flower data set, i converted it into an application that others can use. This part of the project is a pair of Python scripts that run from the command line. For testing, i used the checkpoint i saved in the first part.
